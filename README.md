# LIFE-PREDICTOR-TOOL

ðŸ“– Overview

The Life Predictor Tool is a thoughtfully designed wellness application that encourages users to reflect on their life journey by visualizing how much of their expected lifespan has been lived. It blends personal data with simple lifestyle assumptions to provide insights about time, health, and longevity.

# ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project aims to promote mindfulness and intentional living by presenting lifespan data in a visual and intuitive way. It is not a medical tool but a personal reflection interface that encourages users to think deeply about their time on earth and how they wish to use it.

# ðŸ§  Concept

The dashboard takes basic personal inputs such as:

Age

Expected lifespan

Health status

Gender

Location

Using these inputs, it performs simple adjustments (e.g., reducing years for smoking or increasing for certain genders) and calculates:

Remaining years, months, weeks, and days

Percentage of life lived

A graphical life pie chart

Motivational life tips
